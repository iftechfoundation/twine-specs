# Twine 1 TWS (Archive) Output Documentation (v1.0)

**Note:** This is historical documentation on a version of Twine no longer maintained. It is provided to help current and future developers understand and potentially parse files created with Twine 1 or compatible Twee compilers.

In Twine 1, the archive TWS format uses a [byte-stream Python "pickle" serialization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Story metadata and passages are encoded as properties of a single Python object.

**Note**: Although there is no formal specification of the pickle serialization, there are multiple protocols (versions) documented. For specific information on each protocol, consult [PEP 307](https://peps.python.org/pep-0307/), [PEP 3154](https://peps.python.org/pep-3154/), and [PEP 574](https://peps.python.org/pep-0574/). It is strongly recommended to use an existing library or software tool to process the byte-stream rather than attempt to process binary data directly.

For greater human readability, this documentation will translate pickle byte-stream formatting into JSON-encoding to highlight expected properties and possible values.

## Story Properties

Local filepaths for where the last build was saved (if any), `buildDestination` (string), and current, TWS file, `saveDestination` (string) are defined first.

**Example**

```json
{
    "buildDestination": "<filepath>",
    "saveDestination": "<filepath>"
}
```

Story metadata, `metadata` (object), may also be found with an optional property, `description` (string), the description of the story, and an optional property `identity` (string), the noun describing the work such as "story", "game", etc set by the author.

**Note:** In TWS files generated by early versions of Twine 1, the `metadata` object and one or more of its properties may not exist.

**Example**

```json
"metadata": {
    "description": "",
    "identity": ""
}
```

The story format chosen by the author will be encoded as the `target` (string) property:

**Example**

```json
{
    "target": "sugarcane"
}
```

## Story Panel

The `storypanel` (object) property contains all passage data as well as data on visual presentation:

* `snapping`: (boolean) `true` if passages should snap to visual grid; `false` otherwise.
* `scale`: (decimal) scale factor or using two presets:
  * `0`: Zoom to fit
  * `1`: Zoom 100%  

### Passage Data

Individual passage data is encoded within an array property named `widgets` (array).

Each passage object has three properties:

* `selected`: (boolean) `true` if the author had the passage selected when the file was saved; `false` otherwise.
* `pos`: (array) location of the passage within Twine 1 as an array of X (`pos[0]`) and Y (`pos[1]`) positions.
* `passage`: (object) data of the passage:
  * `text`: (string) content of the passage.
  * `title`: (string) title of the passage.
  * `modified`:  (function) Function returning a date stamp. (Translated as empty object in JSON.)
  * `created`: (function) Function returning a date stamp. (Translated as empty object in JSON.)
  * `tags`: (array) Array of tag values (each a string).

**Example**

```json
{
"storyPanel": {
        "widgets": 
        [
            {
                "selected": false,
                "pos": [
                    10,
                    10
                ],
                "passage": {
                    "text": "Your story will display this passage first. Edit it by double clicking it.",
                    "title": "Start",
                    "modified": {},
                    "tags": [
                        "tag1",
                        "tag2",
                        "tag3"
                    ],
                    "created": {}
                }
            }
        ],
        "scale": 1,
        "snapping": false
    }
}
```
